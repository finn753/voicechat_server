With this project, you can setup a voicechat server for godot.
You need the "Voicechat Client" for this to work (https://github.com/finn753/voicechat_client).
To export for a dedicated server see https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_for_dedicated_servers.html
